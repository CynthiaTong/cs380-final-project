## Project Outline 

For my final project, I would like to create a series of web drawings that express the spirit of modern art as I understand it. To achieve this, I plan to create the drawings with abstract geometrical shapes rendered in the browser in certain patterns. The primitive shapes I want to create include but are not limited to circles, squares and lines, and the patterns can range from being very orderly and neat to having a high level of randomness. As I mentioned above, the drawing series are meant to represent some of the iconic features of modern paintings and collages. In addition, I’m hoping to make these drawings “alive” in the sense that users can not only see them but also control some aspect of the webpages themselves, so there will be some animation and user interactivity. For example, the user could decide the color scheme, or the details of the shapes while the overall aesthetics remain consistent. 


To get more inspiration for this project, I’ve been browsing through some examples of modern paintings online, and found the works attached (in the “reference-images” folder) especially interesting. I will use them as references as I create the web drawings. 


Another important feature that I want to incorporate into this project is generating patterns based on Mathematical principles and formulas. As an example, I coded a webpage on which the line’s positions are determined by Gaussian Distribution (see sketches and code files). The x-position of the vertical lines and the y-position of the horizontal lines deviates from their initial positions in each frame, thus create a pattern that has certain amount of randomness at each point in time. Other drawings that I’m about to create will certainly have their own characteristics, but overall I want some aspects of each drawing to be governed by certain mathematical or physical rules. 


As for the techniques involved, I believe p5 is the most relevant and useful library for this project, but I would also like to explore the possibility of creating one 3D drawing with three.js.
